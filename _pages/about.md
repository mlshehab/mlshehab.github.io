## Welcome !

I'm Mohamad Louai Shehab, a 3rd year Ph.D student in the Robotics Department at the University of Micihgan. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Necmiye Ozay](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/). My research interest broadly span Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Identifiability Theory. 

### Bio

I was born in Beirut, Lebanon. I received a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the American University of Beirut in 2021, both with high distinction.
